# inhostshiny
Shiny App for the implementation in R of the **in-host model**, an epidemiologic compartimental model for the study of the infection of CD4+ T cells by Human T-cell Lymphotropic Virus Type 1. The model is described by Michael Li in section 5.2 of the book **An Introduction to Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Diseases** (Springer, 2018). The evolution of the infectious process, as well as the stability of the equilibrioum of the associated systems of differential equations, can be studied in the app by choosing different values for the parameters of the model.
